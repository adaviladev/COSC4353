**Provide answer to these questions: (20 points)
- Discuss your experience working in pair.
- Did your design change from assignment 3? Why?
Ans:Yes, in the original design, we thought of using only AI module for the level 3 game. But during passing the test cases,
we understood that, when the board is blank, the AI module is not useful to use. All the moves are equally ranked and
thus the system will be in a dilemma to put the turn. That's why we use random turn for the 1st move in the third level
game.
